Pong Game Using Python's Turtle

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics module.

Features
Two Player Control: Control the left paddle using W (up) and A (down) keys, and the right paddle using the Up and Down arrow keys.
Ball Movement: The ball moves continuously, bouncing off the walls and paddles.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the ball and the paddles or walls, causing the ball to bounce.
Scoreboard: Tracks the score for both players. The ball resets to the center when a paddle misses.
Installation


How to Play
Run the main.py file:
python main.py

Control the left paddle with the W (up) and A (down) keys.
Control the right paddle with the Up and Down arrow keys.
The game will keep track of the score and continue until you close the window
